    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>Web Programming I (3) This course provides students with a strong foundation in the principles of web application development from the fundamentals to current technologies. <s>The course focuses on back-end programming rather than website layouts and front-end design.</s> Topics include creating interactive websites, web application architecture, server-side scripting, databases, client-server interactions, and <s>web security</s>. Students are introduced to specific sets of web programming tools including JavaScript, Node.JS, <s>PhP, Python CGI, and SQL</s>. Students gain an understanding of some of the most important technologies that underlie the popular websites they encounter every day, which is both practical for creating web apps and intellectually interesting for computer scientists. Prerequisite: CSC-208.</p>

        <h2>Grades</h2>

    <h3>Weekly Assignments (80%)</h3>
    <p>There will be assignments given most weeks of this course. Each assignment will be evaluated on a 0â€“3 point scale.</p>

    <p><strong>Assignment Evaluation (3 point scale)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>0:</strong> Missing or not functional</li>
        <li><strong>1:</strong> Barely functional; minimal requirements; disorganized code; not impressive</li>
        <li><strong>2:</strong> Functional; meets requirements; reasonably clear/organized</li>
        <li><strong>3:</strong> Strong, polished; goes beyond requirements; well-structured; impressive</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>External Resource Reliance (3 point scale)</strong></p>
    <p>
    For some assignments, a score will be given to communicate to you the instructor's assessment of how much you appear to be relying on external resources. This will not be directly factored into any grades. Instead, it is meant to help you understand how your work engages with the course material.  
    Remember, you should not be turning in code you do not understand, and in general, should not be turning in code you did not write.  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>0:</strong> Clearly did not do the work yourself. Submission shows the code was copied or borrowed without meaningful engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>1:</strong> Heavy reliance on external sources. Much of the code does not appear to be your own, or the style and techniques differ significantly from class content.</li>
        <li><strong>2:</strong> Good engagement with course content. Code is appropriate, and aligns with what we've covered.</li>
        <li><strong>3:</strong> Strong application of course material. Code shows especially thoughtful or creative application of the material.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Verbal Assessment (3 point scale)</strong></p>
    <p>There will be at one or more verbal assessments of your understanding of the assignments given by the instructor. The instructor will decide which questions are appropriate and give an indication of 0, 1, 2, 3 as described below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>0:</strong> Unable to answer questions or demonstrate understanding of the technical material.</li>
        <li><strong>1:</strong> Shows minimal understanding; can answer only basic questions with significant gaps or confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>2:</strong> Demonstrates solid understanding; answers most questions accurately and explains concepts clearly.</li>
        <li><strong>3:</strong> Exhibits deep understanding; provides thorough, insightful explanations and can connect concepts beyond the basics.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Note: A <strong>2</strong> is considered pretty good. That's the expected level for most assignments.</em></p>


    <h3>Participation (20%)</h3>
    <p>Participation is required for all students. Participation will be evaluated based on attendance, participation in class discussions, and participation in group work.</p>


    <h2>Code Understanding and Use of Generative AI</h2>

    <p>All submitted code is expected to be understandable by the author; that is, students must be able to explain their solutions and reasoning. The use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) to produce code is strongly discouraged unless the student already has a full understanding of the concepts involved. Regardless of how the code is written, students will be required to explain all submitted code and project structures during reviews. Failure to demonstrate understanding will negatively impact grades.</p>
    
    <h2>Course Policies</h2>
    <p>Attendance is required. Late assignments will not be accepted.</p>
