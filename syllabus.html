    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>Web Programming I (3) This course provides students with a strong foundation in the principles of web application development from the fundamentals to current technologies. <s>The course focuses on back-end programming rather than website layouts and front-end design.</s> Topics include creating interactive websites, web application architecture, server-side scripting, databases, client-server interactions, and <s>web security</s>. Students are introduced to specific sets of web programming tools including JavaScript, Node.JS, <s>PhP, Python CGI, and SQL</s>. Students gain an understanding of some of the most important technologies that underlie the popular websites they encounter every day, which is both practical for creating web apps and intellectually interesting for computer scientists. Prerequisite: CSC-208.</p>

    <h2>Grades</h2>

    <h3>Projects (80%)</h3>
    <p>There will be three large projects in this course. Each project will be evaluated on a 0–6 point scale, with a total of 18 points possible.</p>

          <td><strong>3</strong></td>
          <td>Strong, polished; goes beyond requirements; well-structured; impressive</td>
          <td>Deep, confident understanding; clear explanations; strong answers &amp; connections</td>

    </table>
    
    <p><strong>Each project = up to 6 points (3 + 3).</strong><br>
    <strong>3 projects total = 18 points.</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Participation (20%)</h3>
    <p>Participation is required for all students. Participation will be evaluated based on attendance, participation in class discussions, and participation in group work.</p>
    
    

    <h2>Code Understanding and Use of Generative AI</h2>

    <p>All submitted code is expected to be understandable by the author; that is, students must be able to explain their solutions and reasoning. The use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) to produce code is strongly discouraged unless the student already has a full understanding of the concepts involved. Regardless of how the code is written, students will be required to explain all submitted code and project structures during reviews. Failure to demonstrate understanding will negatively impact grades.</p>
    
    <h2>Course Policies</h2>
    <p>Attendance is required. Late assignments will not be accepted.</p>
